<p>A 55-year-old obese man presents to the emergency department for a 3-day history of progressive pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on his right knee. The patient denies a history of recent trauma, prior knee surgery, sick contacts, or similar symptoms in the past. The patient states he has had fevers and chills over this time. His past medical history is notable for poorly controlled non – insulin-dependent diabetes and alcohol abuse. He is febrile with a temperature of 38o C and has an elevated heart rate of 110 beats/minute. His blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Examination of the knee demonstrates a swollen, erythematous, and diffusely tender right knee that is warm to palpation with painful and limited passive range of motion. Radiographs of the knee are negative for an acute fracture or dislocation but do show an effusion. The patient’s laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19,100 cells/μ L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 48 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 20 mg/L. Blood cultures are pending.</p>
