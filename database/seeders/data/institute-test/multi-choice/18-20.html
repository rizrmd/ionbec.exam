The small finger of the right hand is most affected. The left hand is also affected, but not as severe. He denies any history of trauma or previous hand problems, and he has no complaints of pain, nor finger locking or clicking. His father had similar problems with his hands. The patientâ€™s past medical history includes high cholesterol and blood pressure. More than 5 years ago, he underwent surgery for early-stage colon cancer, and since then has been cancer-free. He currently does not drink alcohol, although he drank heavily during his younger years. He is of English-Irish decent. <i>Examination of both hands reveals nodules and skin thickening in the palm along the small finger ray. The right small finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is fixed at 45 degrees of flexion, and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is fixed at 20 degrees.</i> There is no redness, tenderness, edema, or pain with passive flexion.
