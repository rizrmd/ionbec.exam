<p>A 34-year-old female is involved in a motorcycle crash. She sustains a talus fracture with associated dislocation of the subtalar joint and maintained congruence of the tibiotalar and talonavicular joints as shown in Figure A. The fracture has healed and she now has symptomatic impingement of the dorsal surface of the talus on the distal tibia and restriction of ankle dorsiflexion. What is the most likely deformity causing these symptoms?</p>
