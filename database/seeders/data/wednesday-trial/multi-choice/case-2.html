    <p>A 17-year-old male sustained an injury to his middle finger while catching a football. When examined by his coach on the field, it was felt to be a sprain, and he continued playing the game. After he finished the game, he was noted to have a finger bent at the distal inter phalangeal joint, and he was unable to straighten it (Fig. 4). He was seen in the emergency room where x-ray showed no fracture. He was then splinted and asked to see you in consultation.</p>
